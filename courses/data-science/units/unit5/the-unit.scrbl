                                Imagine you are in a casino, and a stranger invites you to play a game.  

                                In this game, you start by guessing a number between 2 and 12.  The stranger rolls two dice,
                                and add the numbers together.  If that number matches your number, you win the jackpot!
                                If your number is wrong, then you lose your money. How can we maximize our chances of winning?

                                we can come up with a good guess for what the dice roll will be.

                                                    Hover over the middle bar, for the number 7.  How many 
                                                    times was a 7 rolled?
                                                }
                                                @item{
                                                    Out of the 10000 rolls, is this more than half?  Less than half?
                                                }
                                                @item{
                                                    Run the code to make the histogram a few more times.  Is the 
                                                    number of times 7 appears ever more than 5000 times?
                                                }
                                        ]
                                }

                                The roll 7 is definitely the roll that happens the most often.  However, it never
                                appears more than half of the 10000 rolls.  That means, most of the time we 
                                play this game, we would lose!  We should definitely NOT play this game!  If
                                a stranger ever offers to play this game with you, walk away and put your 
                                money into a savings account.

                                In the dice roll game, there were 11 possible numbers that the dice roll 
                                could produce, so we only need 11 bars.  But what happens when our quantitative data has decimals?

                                For example, let's look again at our favorite 4th grade class:

                                @build-table/cols[
                                        '("First" "Last" "Height")

                                          ("\"Doe\"" "\"Smith\"" "\"Jackson\"" "\"Enriquez\"" "\"Thompson\"" "\"Rodriguez\"" "\"Carter\"" "\"Garcia\"")

                                ]

                                If we want to make a histogram for heights of students, how many possible values are there? 10? 100?
                                The values of heights have decimals.  If we want to have a bar for every possible height value, how
                                many bars do we need?
                        }
                        @teacher{
                                Guide discussion towards the fact that there are infinitely many values that height could take,
                                so we can't have a bar for each one.

                        @student{
                                The answer is, we can't have a bar for every possible height.  However, a long time ago, some very
                                clever data scientists came up with a way around this problem...

                                @activity[#:forevidence "BS-IDE&1&1"]{
                                        Turn to @worksheet-link[#:name "Histograms"] 
                                        in your workbook and complete the exercise.
                                }

                        @teacher{
                                In this workbook activity, students will explicitly count the frequency of 
                                values appearing within certain ranges.  They will draw the bar corresponding
                                to a particular bin.
                        }
                }

                        @student{
                                The histogram that you completed only has 5 bars, yet each possible value contributes to the
                                height of a particular bar.  This is possible because each of the decimal values is put into 
                                a @vocab{bin}.  Each @code{bin} is a range of values that our data can take.  
                        }
                        @teacher{
                                Before this discussion, ask students to describe in their 
                                own words how histograms can visualize the 
                                frequency of an unlimited number of values, using a limited number of bars.
                        }
                }
                @point{
                        @student{
                                Look back at your call to the @code{histogram} function for the dice game.
                                The second argument is the number of bins we want to use in our histogram.
                                In the first example, it made sense to use 11 bins because there were only 11 possible
                                values that the pair of dice could produce.  However, for the table of heights,
                                we use 5 bins, each of size 2.

                                @activity[#:forevidence "BS-IDE&1&1"]{
                                        What would happen if we only used 4 bins for the dice game?  What
                                        if we used 40?
                                        Try them out with new function calls in the interactions window.
                                }

                                Using only 4 bins gives us a histogram that is less helpful, because 
                                11 bins more accurately covers the range from 2 to 12.  However,
                                40 isn't any more helpful, because there are so many bins that are empty.
