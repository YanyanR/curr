                            Welcome to Bootstrap: DataScience. In this course, 
                            you'll learn how to ask and answer questions about data.  The process 
                            of learning from data is called @vocab{Data Science}.  Data science techniques 
                            are used by scientists, business people, politicians, sports analysts, 
                            and hundreds of other different fields to ask and answer questions about data.

                            languages have their own vocabulary and grammar that you will need to learn.  
                            The language you'll be learning for data science is Pyret, which lets you ask 
                            and answer questions quickly from very large data sets.

                            to answer may be out of scope.  However, this course will give students

                            taken up by two large boxes: the @vocab{Definitions area} on the left and the

                            The Definitions area is where programmers define values and functions in their program,

                            This is analogous to writing a series of function definitions on a blackboard, and having 
                            student evaluate expressions using those function on scrap paper. As students are not yet 
                            defining values of their own, it is not important that students understand this distinction 
                            right now.  For now, we will work only with the Interactions area.

                            Congratulations, you've written your first program!  Yes, really.  When a program
                            is run, the editor will turn that program into a @vocab{value}.  Values are how the computer represents
                            data.  In this case, the editor's job is easy because the program is already a value!  When we hit Run,
                            we @vocab{evaluate} the program, which is another way of saying "give me the value that is produced by
                            this program".

                                    What happens if you write a decimal? What happens when you click on
                                    a decimal, like @code{0.75}? You get a new type of number, a 
                                    fraction, like @code{3/4}.

                            The editing environment evaluates all fractions and returns them as decimals by default. This can be
                            surprising to students at first, so you may want to take a moment to explain what's going on, and 
                            show them that these decimals can be converted back to fractions just by clicking on them.  The 
                            environment uses standard annotations for repeating, non-terminating decimal expressions and 
                            properly handles expressions like @math{(\sqrt -1)}.  If you want to work with those kinds of 
                            numbers in your class, enter them to get familiar with how they appear in the Interactions area.

                            All values that a computer program can produce have a @vocab{type}.  Each of the values 
                            produced by the programs you just wrote are Numbers.  Another fundamental type is @vocab{String}.  A String
                            is a sequence of characters (letters, numbers, symbols) in between a pair of quotation marks @code{""}.

                                                 code into the Interactions area and hit Return: @code{"I love writing programs}

                            The program @code{"4"} is a String.  Even though this string only contains the character for the number 4,
                            it is a String because it is between quotation marks.  Data scientists care about this distinction, because
                            we often run into data that is represented in a String but should be considered a number by Pyret.  This will
                            become more relevant later in the course, for now stress to the students that anything within quotations is 
                            a String.  Pyret is helpful in detecting strings because it highlights them green.

                    @student{
                            Notice when you leave off the second quotation mark, @code{"I love writing programs} is NOT
                            printed on the next line;  instead, we get a big red box.  This big red box is an @vocab{error message}.
                            The editor gives us error messages when a program can't be properly evaluated.


                            Error messages are really helpful, and they're a natural part of
                            programming;  they exist so that the computer can help you find
                            small mistakes in your code.  In the case above,
                            without the second quotation mark the computer can't figure out when the end of the String is, which makes
                            evaluation impossible.

                                    Fix the error described in the error messages by typing @code{"I love writing programs"}

                            It is crucial to encourage students to read error messages and debug their code.  Often, when a student
                            encounters an error message for the first time, they will throw their hand up and tell the teacher 
                            "I did something wrong".  When helping students with this, make sure to ask questions about the answer 
                            rather than fixing code for them.

                            be boring.  Luckily, Pyret allows us to compute new values using old values in @vocab{expression}s.

                            Let's break this down.  @code{2 + 5} is an expression, and this expression is made up of values
                            and an @vocab{operator}.  Here the operator is +, which is the standard addition you've seen in
                            math classes:  adding two values to create a new value.

                            Some of you may have gotten an error when trying to run this program.  This error happened 
                            because Pyret needs you to write spaces between numbers and operators.  To address this issue,
                            add spaces between the operator and values.

                            Parentheses allow you to write more complex expressions.  In this example, Pyret evaluates what is inside the parentheses: @code{2 * 3}.
                            Then, it uses this value in the larger expression.  So @code{(2 * 3) + 5} becomes @code{6 + 5}, 
                            which is evaluated to 11.  @bold{Note:} There is one difference between the way parentheses work in math class, and the way they do in Pyret! In Pyret, any time you have more than one operation, you @bold{must} include parenthesis.

                                pizza too!)  How would you rewrite this program to compute the cost of paying

                                            Pyret needs both parentheses around the arguments, so that 
                                            it knows exactly where function call begins and ends.  This
                                            is similar to the error with Strings needing both quotation

                            we need to keep track of what arguments it takes, and what type of
                            value it returns.

                            We do this by writing @vocab{contracts}.  @vocab{Contracts}
                            are comments in code that give the programmer instructions on what
                            functions take in and output.  Below is the contract for
                            @code{num-min}:

                            @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                                    # num-min : Number Number -> Number
                            }

                            The first part of a contract is the function name.  This function
                            is @code{num-min}, so that part is easy.  @code{num-min} takes two
                            arguments of type Number, so we write Number Number.  Finally, after
                            the arrow goes the type of the function's output, which in this case is
                            Number.

                            learning to use values, variables, operations and functions, you are now familiar with the 
                            fundamental concepts needed to write programs.  You will have many opportunities to
                            use these concepts in the next units, by writing programs to answer data science questions.
